Project Name: Rover Run
Authors: Seifeleslam, Ibrahima Sory, Rawad
Description:
This project simulates the movement of the MARC rover on a Martian map. The goal is to guide the rover to a base station by minimizing costs and navigating terrain constraints.

Key Features:
Optimized movement sequences using an N-ary tree.
Cost-based pathfinding with terrain influences.
Simulation of real-world rover constraints and phased movements.
How to Use:
Compile the Code: Ensure you have a C compiler and all necessary dependencies installed.
Run the Simulation: Execute the program to see MARC navigate the Martian map.
Input: Provide the starting coordinates, map details, and base station location.
Output: The best sequence of movements and the final path cost.
Requirements:
C Compiler
Basic understanding of 2D grids and algorithms.
